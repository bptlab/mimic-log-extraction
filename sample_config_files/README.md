## Sample Config Files
This folder includes the config files as mentioned in the paper. On the one hand, the event logs from the Demonstration section are provided of which the process models were illustrated in the paper.
On the other hand, the reproduced config files of the event logs presented in Related Work are provided and named according to their reference occurence. We were able to reproduce the raw event logs from [3], [5], [6], [17], and [18].
With raw event logs, we mean that manual postprocessing, such as event abstraction or trace clustering, is not provided by our tool.

The event log generated by [19] starts with manual processing, as the disease table including the ICD codes does not contain timestamps. For the event log by [21], the original table does not exist anymore, so we used different tables including a more detailed description of procedures performed in the ICU. Those, it is not the original raw event log, but still one where the event abstraction can be performed
